# Technical Test for Applied Scientist (Data Scientist)

__Opportunity No. 44081__

## 1. Task Overview

This project tackles a forecasting task using the Toronto Island Ferry Ticket dataset, with two objectives: (1) improve a base model for predicting daily ticket redemptions, and (2) build a new model to forecast daily ticket sales. I used a 365-day forecast horizon, as defined in the provided base model, which limited the use of future exogenous variables like weather or tourism data, as they are unreliable to predict that far ahead. As a result, models relied solely on historical patterns to capture the strong seasonality in sales. Calendar features (e.g., holidays, weekends, school breaks) were excluded in this initial iteration but are noted for future work. The aim was to outperform the baseline while maintaining realistic assumptions and reproducibility.

## 2. Data Overview
The original dataset from the City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal records ferry ticket sales and redemptions at 15-minute intervals. As with the base model, this data was aggregated to daily frequency, producing two time series: daily sales and redemption counts.

The series exhibit strong seasonal patterns, peaking during warmer months. Model performance was evaluated using an expanding window with four train/test splits, where each training set grew incrementally and the subsequent 365 days served as unseen test data. This approach assesses model robustness across different time periods. To prevent data leakage and ensure realistic forecasting, only features available at training time were used, with test data reserved strictly for evaluation, assuming no knowledge of future exogenous variables.

## 3. Models Overview

Several forecasting models were implemented for both target variables:
- **Historical Average by Day**: A simple benchmark using daily averages from the training set to predict test values.
- **ARIMAX**: Autoregressive models with exogenous inputs. To forecast one target (sales or redemptions), the other was used as a regressor. Since future values are unavailable for the 365-day test period, test-time regressors were replaced with their historical daily averages from the training set.
- **ARIMAX on Residuals**: Same as ARIMAX, but applied to the time series with the seasonal component removed. The seasonal component for the test set was estimated using the Base Model and added back to obtain the final forecast.
- **SARIMAX**: Extends ARIMAX by including seasonal terms to explicitly capture recurring patterns.
- **Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Meta that fits non-linear trends with additive yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, as well as holiday effects.
- **Ensemble**: An average of forecasts from ARIMAX, SARIMAX, Prophet, and the Historical Average. ARIMAX on Residuals was excluded as its inclusion reduced overall performance.

Hyperparameters were tuned using greedy search, guided by exploratory techniques such as stationarity checks (ADF), seasonal decomposition (STL), and autocorrelation analysis (ACF/PACF). Full details are available in the Jupyter notebook Exploratory Data Analysis in this repository.

## 4. Results

The ensemble model delivered the best performance in both tasks. Performance was measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) on the 365-day test horizon.

## 5. Conclusions

This project showed that classical forecasting methods and a simple ensemble can significantly outperform the baseline, reducing Mean Absolute Error by ~39% for both sales and redemptions. Developed under realistic constraints and evaluated with an expanding window, the models demonstrate the value of well-tuned, interpretable approaches for accurate long-term forecasts.

## 6. Future Work

Future work should focus on incorporating **known future events** (e.g., public holidays, school breaks), exploring **neural network approaches** such as LSTMs or Transformers to capture long-term dependencies, and adopting **probabilistic forecasting** to quantify uncertainty.
